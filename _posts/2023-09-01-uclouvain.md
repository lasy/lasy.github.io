Hi there!

Delighted to share that *today* was my first day as Assistant Prof in *non-clinical biostatistics* at UCLouvain, at ISBA, the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics, and Actuarial Sciences. 
My colleagues have been extremely welcoming, and I'm excited for this new role. I'm looking forward to meeting students and starting new collaborations.
