In this [paper](http://lasy.github.io/publication/2023-Symul-VMRC-subcommunities), we show that mixed membership models - here, topic models (LDA) - better describe vaginal microbiota composition than "community (state) types" that are based on clustering approaches. 
They also better predict the risk of transitioning to a sub-optimal state (loss of Lactobacillus dominance) and better describe longitudinal changes along menstrual cycles.


The identification of the topics rely on a package ([alto](https://lasy.github.io/alto/index.html)) previously developed with Kris Sankaran and Julia Fukuyama and described [here](http://lasy.github.io/publication/2021-Fukuyama).


So, if you're in need of a dimension reduction method for representing microbiota data, these described here might be a good option. Would love to discuss if you end up trying or finding something that better suit your neeeds.

I warmly thanks all my co-authors, the VMRC for their relentless efforts in understanding the vaginal microbiota and how to restore it to a healthy state, and the study participants who accepted a quite intensive collection of swabs.
