I just came back from a wonderful week in Durban as part of the teaching team of the [Durban Data Science for Biology](https://elsherbini.github.io/durban-data-science-for-biology/) workshop.

The workshop was offered by a consortium of research institution and masterfully organized by Scott Handley, Joseph Elsherbini and Chandani Desai.

It's been a lot of fun working with this super diverse crowd (a bit less than 100 participants coming from all over Africa) and I hope that participants have enjoyed it as much as I did. Above all, I hope this workshop was useful and will open many doors for further learning about reproducible quantitative analyses of biological data.
