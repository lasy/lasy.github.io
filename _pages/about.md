I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University, in the Department of Statistics, working with [Prof. Holmes](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html).

My research focuses on women's health and menstrual health in particular. This includes research on fertility, on cycle-related symptoms and on drivers of changes in vaginal microbiome communities. I use a combination of self-tracked data from mobile phone apps and devices and clinical multi-omics data.

I obtained my PhD in computational biology from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, where I worked on the molecular regulation of the circadian clock. In particular I was interested in the regulation of rhythmic gene expression and protein translation combining analyses of -omics data with mathematical models describing the regulatory dynamics to infer quantities otherwise not measurable.
I have also specialized in the visualization of data and, during my industry experience, has helped companies to take data-driven decisions.
